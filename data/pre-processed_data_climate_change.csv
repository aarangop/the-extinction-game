Toby Ord,"Amount by which existential risk till 2120 would decrease if ""we could just somehow have the next century but make it so that climate change wasn’t an issue""",2020,0.1-1 percentage points,Yes,climate_change,"""Toby Ord: [...] I think that if we imagine a world, if we could just somehow have the next century but make it so that climate change wasn’t an issue. All of the dedicated altruists who are working on fighting climate change could then work on other things and global international tensions on this would go down and so nations could spend their “altruistic international corporation” kind of budget on something else. So I do think that that could actually be quite helpful. As to how big it is as a risk factor, my guess would be somewhere between… these are very rough kind of guesses, between about 0.1% and 1%. So maybe a bit bigger as a risk factor, but not an order of magnitude. Probably not a whole order of magnitude bigger."" 

It's possible he means 0.1-1% *of the total risk level over the next 100 years*, which would correspond to ~0.017-0.17 percentage points. But he estimates climate change itself/directly poses a 1/1000 risk, and says that it's bigger as a risk factor, which only makes sense if he meant 0.1-1 percentage points of risk from climate change as a risk factor.
