Toby Ord,Amount by which existential risk till 2120 would decrease if there definitely wouldn't be a great power war during that time,2020,"~1.7 percentage points (""something like a tenth"" of the ~1/6 total risk over that time)",Yes,war,"""Consider your own estimate of how much existential risk there is over the next hundred years. How much of this would disappear if you knew that the great powers would not go to war with each other over that time? It is impossible to be precise, but I’d imagine that an appreciable fraction would disappear - something like a tenth of the existential risk over that time.""",The Precipice,
Will MacAskill,"Likelihood that, if an existential risk in the 21st century occurs, it occurs during ""wartime or something"" [it's possible this isn't quite what he meant]",2019/2020,0.9,Yes,war,"""in terms of my estimates for existential risk over the century, I would put 90% of the risk coming from wartime or something precisely because people… If you tell me someone’s done something, a country’s done something incredibly stupid and kind of against their own interest or in some sense of global interest, it’s probably happened during a war period.""

It's not entirely clear to me what MacAskill meant. In particular, note that he did *not* explicitly say that he thinks causing there to be no war during the 21st century would reduce x-risk this century by 90% of its current level. (E.g., one could believe that a TAI transition would contribute significant x-risk whether or not a war is on, but that, given there'll likely be war at some point, that's likely to bring forward the time at which that TAI transition and dangerous effects of it occur.)",https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/will-macaskill-paralysis-and-hinge-of-history/#transcript,0.9
