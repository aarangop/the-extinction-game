"Ben Todd or 80,000 Hours",The chance of “a civilization-ending nuclear war” (or one that causes extinction?) in “the next century”,2017,Probably at or above 0.3%,Yes,nanotechnology,"It’s also worth noting that Todd uses the phrases “permanently end civilization” and “civilization-ending nuclear war” here, but the article and some other estimates in it are focused on extinction, rather than other scenarios like permanent collapse. I’m thus not sure precisely what scenarios Todd is estimating (or broadly discussing) the risk of.",https://80000hours.org/articles/extinction-risk/,
Dave Denkenberger or ALLFED,“Reduction in far future potential per year from [the risk of a?] full scale nuclear war”,2018,~0.29%,Sort-of,nanotechnology,"There's some relevant info/discussion in these three sources (especially the first two): https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CcNY4MrT5QstNh4r7/cost-effectiveness-of-foods-for-global-catastrophes-even https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/david-denkenberger-allfed-and-feeding-everyone-no-matter-what/ https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/D8t5TtSemqcGa4g7Y/my-open-for-feedback-donation-plans#1__Should_I_donate_to_ALLFED_ Denkenberger's model includes an estimate of the annual probability of nuclear war, based on Barrett 2013, and an estimate of the impacts a nuclear war would have if it occurred, based on a survey he sent to “31 GCR researchers”, which “got seven responses (including [Denkenberger himself])”. He multiplies these figures together to get the “Reduction in far future potential per year from full scale nuclear war” (which I believe should say “from the risk of a full scale nuclear war”). The estimate for that is ~0.29%.
