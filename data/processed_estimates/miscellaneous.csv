"Matthew Barnett","0.1-0.2% SETI risk in 1000 years",0.00015,"Low","Medium","Averaged range and scaled from 1000 years to 100. Low confidence due to self-described 'non-robust' estimate."
"Holden Karnofsky (human)","≥50% PASTA impact this century",0.5,"Medium","High","Direct century estimate. Conditional on PASTA development. Medium confidence due to speculative nature."
"Holden Karnofsky (galaxy)","≥25% PASTA impact this century",0.25,"Medium","High","Direct century estimate. Conditional on PASTA development. Medium confidence due to speculative nature."
"Wei Dai","≥50% value loss from poor deliberation",0.5,"Medium","Low","Unclear timeframe assumed to be century. Medium confidence as estimate includes detailed reasoning."
"Paul Christiano","20% value loss from poor deliberation",0.2,"Medium","Low","Unclear timeframe assumed to be century. Medium confidence due to explicit breakdown of factors."
"Toby Ord (environmental)","0.1% by 2120",0.00083,"High","High","Scaled from 98 years to 100 years. High confidence due to detailed methodology."
"Pamlin & Armstrong (ecological)","0.5% in 100 years",0.005,"Medium","High","Direct century estimate. Medium confidence due to scope uncertainty."
"Toby Ord (unforeseen)","3% by 2120",0.025,"Medium","High","Scaled from 98 years to 100 years. Medium confidence due to inherent uncertainty of 'unforeseen' risks."
"Toby Ord (other anthro)","2% by 2120",0.0167,"High","High","Scaled from 98 years to 100 years. High confidence due to detailed methodology."
"Toby Ord (total anthro)","17% by 2120",0.142,"High","High","Scaled from 98 years to 100 years. High confidence due to comprehensive analysis."
"Pamlin & Armstrong (uncertain)","0.5% in 100 years",0.005,"Low","High","Direct century estimate. Low confidence due to explicitly uncertain nature."
"Dave Denkenberger","0.15% annual agricultural",0.139,"Medium","Medium","Converted annual to century: 1-(1-0.0015)^100. Medium confidence due to detailed model."
"Anders Sandberg","0.00023% annual agricultural",0.00023,"Medium","Medium","Converted annual to century: 1-(1-0.0000023)^100. Medium confidence due to model adaptation."
"Brian Tomasik","5% in millions of years (non-AGI)",0.0005,"Low","Low","Very rough scaling to century. Low confidence due to extremely long timeframe."
"Pablo Stafforini","10% in millions of years (non-AGI)",0.001,"Low","Low","Very rough scaling to century. Low confidence due to extremely long timeframe."
"Brian Tomasik (collapse)","20% civilization collapse",0.2,"Low","Medium","Assumed century timeframe. Low confidence due to approximate nature ('Maybe ~20%?')."
