    "We're going to model risk and survival probability using a probability cascade.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can formulate this as a \"game\", namely the \"extinction game\", to be more dramatic. In this game humanity *wins* and gets to play again, or it *loses* and doesn't get to play again. What exactly it means to lose is debatable, it could either mean civilization collapse, or extinction. However, the most generic scenario is one where humanity's potential to flourish is destroyed. This could mean either full-fledged extinction, or it could be the establishment of ultra stable dystopia, or civilization's collapse without the ability to recover."
